+ It can be compoled on a variety of computer platforms

## Facts about C

+ C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX
+ C is s successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s
+ The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institue(ANSI)
+ The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
+ Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language
+ Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implememted using C.

 ## Why use C
 C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system.

 + OS
 + Compilers
 + Assemblers
 + Text Editors
 + Databases
